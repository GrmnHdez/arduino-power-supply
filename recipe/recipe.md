# Arduino Power Supply Recipe

Recipe to build the Arduino Power Supply project

## Components

* Myrra AC/DC module 5V 0.5W ()
* 2-pin screw terminal 5mm pitch ([https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8432](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8432))
* 4-pin header ([https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116))
* LM7803 voltage regulator ()
* 10uF capacitor ()
* 1uF capacitor ()
* PCB (see Fabrication step)

## Fabrication

* Send the EAGLE files at []() 
* Send these files to a PCB manufacturer
* Wait until your receive the PCB

## Assembly

* Mount all the small components on the PCB and solder them
* Mount the Myrra AC/DC module and solder it

## Test

* Connect the 2-pin screw terminal to the main power, for example with a male power plug
* Use a voltmeter to check the output 5V & 3.3V pins
